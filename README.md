### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dominik I am a BSc Computer Science graduate from the University of Hull in England. I am especially interested in mobile app development. I have worked with native Android development, and recently Flutter. I am currently working on a [Calculator application](https://github.com/Domininiuk/calculator) using Flutter. My previous complete project was a [Meditation Timer and Mood Journal application](https://github.com/Domininiuk/Meditation_timer) developed with Kotlin.
