### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dominik and I am a BSc Computer Science graduate from the University of Hull in England. I am interested in mobile app development, especially native Android development and recently, Flutter.
I am currently working on a [https://github.com/Domininiuk/calculator](Calculator application) using Flutter. My latest complete project is a [https://github.com/Domininiuk/Meditation_timer](Meditation Timer and Mood Journal application) developed with Kotlin.
